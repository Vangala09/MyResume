        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a web developer intern, I enthusiastically delved into various projects, 
            applying my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to contribute to dynamic web solutions.
             Collaborating with experienced professionals, I honed my skills in creating responsive 
             and visually engaging websites and applications. Alongside my technical growth, 
             I bring a unique perspective shaped by my time away from the workforce due to parenting responsibilities.
             This break has fortified my resilience, time management, and adaptability qualities. 
             I'm eager to leverage as I reenter the field and continue my journey as a web developer.
